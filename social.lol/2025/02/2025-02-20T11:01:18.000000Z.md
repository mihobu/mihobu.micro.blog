\# Narada Falls

This is a short clip of \[Narada Falls\]([<span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="">flic.kr/p/2qK52bD</span><span class="invisible"></span>](https://flic.kr/p/2qK52bD)) in Washington. I shot it handheld during our trip there last summer. It is one of a \[collection of short clips\]([<span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="">flic.kr/s/aHBqjC1nZY</span><span class="invisible"></span>](https://flic.kr/s/aHBqjC1nZY)) lasting between 10 and 30 seconds, in which I attempt to capture a moment of quiet contemplation.
