I’m in the process of “refactoring” my [\#<span>photography</span>](https://social.lol/tags/photography) blog at [<span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="">than-no.photo</span><span class="invisible"></span>](https://than-no.photo). The biggest change is that I’ve moved my primary photo hosting back to Flickr, but I’m still working out how to link them into my web experience. I also added [<span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="">pics.than-no.photo</span><span class="invisible"></span>](https://pics.than-no.photo) into the mix, which points to [<span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="">some.pics</span><span class="invisible"></span>](https://some.pics). You may see some duplicate posts and weirdness through the transition, so please excuse the mess.
