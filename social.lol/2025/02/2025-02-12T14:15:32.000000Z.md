So Iâ€™d been having a recurring problem with my Dyson stick vacuum, so I took it into the local Dyson service center (the existence of which I only just learned about) without an appointment. I was in and out with my vac repaired and fully operational within ten minutes. No cost, all covered under warranty. Hoot!
