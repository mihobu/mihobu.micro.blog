Follow up to yesterday’s “Old Motors” post... I just came across the KEYS to the 1983 Ford Escort. I have no idea why I kept them all these years. As a souvenir of my “accomplishment”? These need to go.

Also, I forgot to give credit to <span class="h-card" translate="no">[@<span>ddanielson</span>](https://social.lol/@ddanielson)</span> for inspiring me to write the post in the first place. Thanks, Dave
