I feel kinda bad that I signed up for <span class="h-card" translate="no">[@<span>hiro</span>](https://social.lol/@hiro)</span>’s [\#<span>theCompoChallenge</span>](https://social.lol/tags/theCompoChallenge) and didn’t submit a single photo—I let my other pet projects get in the way—but I commend all the folks who actually made something. Thanks to all for sharing your lovely photos!
