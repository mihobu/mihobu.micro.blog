Great lead actors, a solid supporting case, and a not-too-terrible plot aren’t enough to carry \[You’re Cordially Invited\]([<span class="invisible">https://www.</span><span class="">imdb.com/title/tt21227864</span><span class="invisible"></span>](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt21227864)). Everything about this movie seems to have been half-assed, starting with the unreadable titles. Did they film the first draft of the script? This could have been a good movie, but was ultimately a disappointment. 2½/5
