Trick-or-treat update:

1\. I couldn’t care less about Halloween. It’s my wife’s holiday. But she’s on a conference call so here I am handing out candy to all the local ingrates.

2\. Yet again, my plan to hand out FULL SIZE packs of Halls Mentho-lyptus drops was overruled, so it’s chocolate bars instead. Boring.

3\. We’re almost out of said chocolate, and we’re only 30 minutes in.
