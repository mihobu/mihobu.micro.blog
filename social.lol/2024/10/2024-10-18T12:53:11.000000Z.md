I made a significant update to my photography weblog this week, which includes a dramatic new visual style and layout that is more appropriate for photos than what I was using previously. It supports dark mode too! I'm still in the process of migrating content over to my new CDN so the older posts are missing cover images. Let me know what you think. Suggestions and bug reports welcome!
