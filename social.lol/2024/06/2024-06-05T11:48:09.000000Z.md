Hey there Fedi-friends! I have a favor to ask.

My daughter, a fine art student and aspiring photographer, is studying abroad this month in Florence. Sheâ€™s been posting daily updates so we can keep up with her adventures. If you happen to be on Instagram, please consider giving her a like or two. Cheers!
