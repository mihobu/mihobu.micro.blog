Question for the group (but mostly for <span class="h-card" translate="no">[@<span>robb</span>](https://social.lol/@robb)</span> and <span class="h-card" translate="no">[@<span>adam</span>](https://social.lol/@adam)</span>): Is there a way to get EchoFeed to pull in the tags from my blog posts on weblog.lol? Neither `{{ tags }}` nor `{{ hashtags }}` seems to do the trick. Is this a limitation (of EchoFeed, weblog, or RSS)? Or something Iâ€™m doing wrong?
