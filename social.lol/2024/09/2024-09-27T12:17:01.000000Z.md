Happy Friday!

I have a question for my blogger homies: how do you feel about dates in the path of your blog posts? For example:

/2024/09/here-is-the-slug

If I update content (and the timestamp) then my path changes. Would it be better NOT to have the year and month in the path? Or do you view posts as immutable things that should not change once published? I'm considering eliminating the Y/m part and just having globally unique slugs.

Thoughts?
