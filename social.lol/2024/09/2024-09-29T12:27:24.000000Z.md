I got some good feedback on the blog URL question from the other day. Opinions were mixed.

I’ve decided to pull the trigger and remove the year and month from the path. It’d be nice if I could redirect the old links automatically on the server side, but to do that would mean some 175 manual entries in the config and I’m not gonna do that. I’ll just have to live with a few broken links.
