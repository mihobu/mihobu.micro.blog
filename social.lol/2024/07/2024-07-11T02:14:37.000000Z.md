Was talking with my daughter recently about how my system for rating books, movies, and shows was flawed because it conflates quality with enjoyment. It’s possible to like a “bad” movie or to dislike a “good” book.

So… BECAUSE I AM A NERD, I formulated a new rating system based on a 2-dimensional assessment that works on 5-star scales with and without half stars and 10-star scales. (The math is different for each.)
